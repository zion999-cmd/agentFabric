// P0010.1 Post-Productization REPAIR — minimal Output / WorkItem contract.
//
// A WorkItem is the Agent's "deliverable" — what the Agent has produced that
// the human is supposed to look at / acknowledge / close. This is a thin
// surface, NOT a ticket system. There is no transport, no delivery engine,
// no approval flow. The status enum is the only state machine.
//
// Why JSON-in-body, not a new SQL table:
//   - Existing `learning_contexts.body` is JSON; adding `outputs[]` is
//     additive (default []) and does not require a migration.
//   - The 5-7 existing fields (`interventions[]`, `actions[]`, `outcomes[]`)
//     are already stored this way, so the pattern is established.
//   - The audit (Output/WorkItem) classified this as REUSE with a single new
//     field; no producer changes are required for the 3 demo situations.
//
// What this contract does NOT do:
//   - It does NOT represent Action execution (Agent never executes business
//     actions in this slice — see runtime/investigation/prompt.ts:196-198).
//   - It does NOT transport to Feishu / WeCom / Email / Telegram.
//   - It does NOT poll, wake, or schedule review.
//   - It does NOT have a delivery acknowledgement by an external system.
//     `acknowledged` is set by the human pressing a button in Workspace.
//   - It does NOT auto-advance on page load. The `mark-delivered`
//     convenience endpoint was REMOVED in P0010.1 REPAIR-5; opening the
//     Workspace does not change any WorkItem's status.
//
// Status semantics (the only state machine; canonical Chinese label):
//   - `ready`        — 待交付 — Agent has produced this; the Operator is
//                       expected to look at the deliverable.
//   - `delivered`    — 已交付 — The Agent has surfaced the item to the
//                       Workspace surface. Operator-driven transition
//                       (e.g. via the per-Output acknowledge/close actions
//                       in the Output Detail view), NOT auto on page load.
//   - `acknowledged` — 已确认 — The Operator has explicitly clicked
//                       "已知悉" / "确认收到" on the deliverable.
//   - `closed`       — 已关闭 — The Operator has closed the deliverable.
//                       This is a per-WorkItem transition. It does NOT
//                       close the parent Situation. The Situation has its
//                       own lifecycle (pending / investigating / watching
//                       / waiting_human / closed) and a separate resolution
//                       contract. Recommendation adoption by the Operator
//                       is an Intervention (`decision: accept/reject`),
//                       NOT a close path for either the WorkItem or the
//                       Situation.
